    Author:  Penofcilin, King of KO Audio
    Purpose: Provides a useful LFO class for use within a JUCE process block.
    Adapted from Viator DSP's LFOGenerator Module

    You can also use this as a regular oscillator if you want.

       sine begins it's phase at 0 on an amplitude of -1 to 1, so on a scale of 0 to 1 thats actually 0.5 if you think about it.
       Cosine on the other hand either starts at -1 or 1, depending on negative or positive.
       Positive cosine starts off at 1, so thats maximum modulation.
       Negative cosine starts at -1, so on a scale of 0 to 1, that's no modulation.
       Squares are squares.
